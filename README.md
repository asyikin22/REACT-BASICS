# BASIC CONCEPTS

**Required JavaScript Knowledge**:
* Arrays
* Classes
* Objects
* Arrow functions

**Thinking in React**
*  Source: https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react
* It's a tool that makes writing front-end application easier
* To break up codes into different components
* Combine everything together to make your application
* Look at the final result - break it down into components

# REACT - PROJECT STRUCTURE

**Creating our first component - delete the sample project**
* Note that the app.jsx is the sample project, not the project we created.
* App.jsx was imported into main.jsx - import App from './App.jsx'Create root element - app component
  1) delete everything inside function to create our component
  2) Delete import
*  Keep the export statement
*  We can delete App.jsx as we no longer need it

# SIMPLE PROJECT - FOOD WEBSITE

**HEADER COMPONENT**

**Got to src folder, create header file Header.jsx**
* Create function header
* Write export statement
* Add return statement
* Create pure HTML inside return - Header element
* React component is only capable of returning a single element, but you can place children element within

**App component**
* Import the header component
* Type import, name of component, from, location of folder
* Write a return statement
* Add angle brackets (<></>)and type the name of the component - they're a pair of two
* The alternative syntax would be <Header/>

**ADD ELEMENTS INTO HEADER COMPONENT**
* Navigation
* Unordered list
* Wrap lists inside anchor element
* Horizontal line

**FOOTER COMPONENT**

**Go to src folder, create a Footer.jsx file**
* Create a function based component - it returns a footer component
* Add a paragraph to create trademark
* Export the footer component using export statement into App.jsx

**App Component**
* Import footer component
* Type import, name of component, from, location of folder
* Write a return statement for Footer component
* BUT React component is only capable of returning a single element - WE WILL GET AN ERROR if we return both Header and Footer
* It will prompt an error and asks us to wrap elements in enclosing tags

**INSERT JAVASCRIPT MEHTOD INTO HTML REACT ELEMENT**
* Add a set of curly braces {}
* We create a new data object - getFullYear method
* It will return the current year - 2024!

**FOOD COMPONENT**

**Go to src folder, create a Food.jsx file**
* Create a function based component
* Add returns statement - it returns a Food component
* Export the footer component using export statement into App.jsx
* Create food variable using JS constant - food1, food2
* Utilize food constants inside return statement using unordered list
* In order to utilize JS, we need to insert them inside curly braces
* We can also add JavaScript method using dot notation (i.e. .toUpperCase)

**App component**
* Import footer component into app component
* Type import, name of component, from, location of folder
* Write a return statement for Food component
* AND OUR SIMPLE FOOD WEBSITE IS NOW COMPLETE! ðŸ˜Š
